# CS215-Project-9

The dataset was too large to upload to github.

Here is the link to where you can download a zip containing the map images and datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skihikingkevin/csgo-matchmaking-damage

The download is in the top right corner and is somewhat large ~600 mb.

For the code in the notebook to work the uncompressed data would have to be in a folder named csgodata
